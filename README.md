## Troubleshooting

* **Error: 'git' is not recognized**
  Git is not installed or not added to PATH. Reinstall Git and check "Add Git to PATH" during installation.

* **Line ending warnings (LF/CRLF)**
  These are safe to ignore. They indicate differences in line-ending formats between Windows and Unix systems.
